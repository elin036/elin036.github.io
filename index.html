                I started crocheting at the beginning of the covid, and I’ve come to really enjoy it because it’s a relaxing hobby that doesn’t demand my full attention. It's perfect for when you're bored or relaxing after a busy day but you want to feel like you're working towards something or making progress. It's also extremely satisfying to see your project come together and the variety of stitches, hook sizes, and yarn types keeps things keeps it from becoming boring. An interesting fact about crocheting is that you can crochet with a variety of different materials like wire, plastic, and fabric strips; It's not limited to just yarn.
